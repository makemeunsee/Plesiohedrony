Scala + lwjgl tessellation demo

Usage
-----

Use "sbt run" and choose the standalone main to start the demo.

Use the second main to connect to an existing standalone demo. Configurations of the standalone and remote client need to be changed if the remote and standalone are launched on different hosts.

Default key bindings are WASD for x,y movements, space to go up, left control to go down, left shift to go faster, F11 to toggle fullscreen.

Left click on a face adds a new polyhedron matching the tessellation in the scene, right click removes it, middle click outputs face info.
