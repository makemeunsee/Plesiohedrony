Scala + lwjgl tessellation demo

Usage
-----

Sbt should take care of everything, so just run "sbt run" to try it.

Different tessellations are available (see Honeycomb subclass), predefined shapes also, although you'd need to hack into the code to try them.

Default key bindings are WASD for x,y movements, space to go up, left control to go down, left shift to go faster, F to toggle fullscreen.
