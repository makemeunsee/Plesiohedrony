Plesiohedrony
=============

Scala + lwjgl tessellation demo

Usage
-----

Sbt should take care of everything, so just run "sbt run" to try it.

Default key bindings are WASD for x,y movements, space to go up, left control to go down, left shift to go faster, F to toggle fullscreen.

Left click on a face adds a new polyhedron matching the tessellation in the scene, right click removes it, middle click outputs face info.

Friendly UI to show off capabilities coming soon...
